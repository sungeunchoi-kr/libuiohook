# How to Build on Windows

Install cmake for Windows.

md build
cd build

Now, run:
cmake -S .. -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -D BUILD_DEMO=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist --debug-find
-- Note that BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF. This builds the static library.

The `--debug-find` option should tell you what directories camke is looking
for if it doesn't find one of the resources it requires.
For our case, it was "advapi32.lib".

Download "advapi32.lib" from "https://github.com/nyx0/Pony/blob/master/source/masm32/lib/advapi32.lib"
and put it in one of the directores cmake searches for.

After the configure stage, run `cmake --build . --parallel 2 --target install`.

The uiohook.lib is output to `\dist\lib`.
